I know this is kinda shooting myself in the foot in regards to working in this industry with these companies since I may get blacklisted as a result, but whatever, I have my own little shitty site for my income now and I'm ready to break off of this type of work :)

So I'll admit - I was the greasy fucker writing reviews for TVape (and many other companies) for the last many years as a freelancer. I also got to learn a lot about how they (and general cannabis industry) operated in the meantime.

So, as many people here have already figured out or speculated, yes, TVape owns Zeus & Utillian. They also own Vapesterdam and are partnered with/own plenty of other companies/brands/white labels.

Having written 100's of reviews for them, worked on a couple dozen videos, etc, I feel somewhat guilty. However every article I wrote (whether it's about Eds TnT, Arizer, or Zeus), would be 'touched-up' by the editor, usually to promote/advertise a ZEUS or Utillian vape, no matter how silly the premise.

"The Crafty+ came up good in our tests, but we found the Zeus Arc GT to be much better overall"

... No surprise, tons of people buy the shittier vape because, well, they expected honesty.

Is the Zeus Arc GT at all as good as the DaVinci IQ or Fury Rogue? Not a chance...! tbh theutillian620issolidthough

However, the worst is Subreddit manipulation and market manipulation

In particular, this subreddit, r/vaporents, has been targeted for manipulation to promote Zeus/Utillian products, introduce shill reviews, quiet-advertising, and other sneaky things. Other Subreddits of course like Arizer, S&B, ents, etc are also targets for shill campaigns.

Those of you who've been part of this subreddit for many years (or mods) have definitely seen some of these shill posts for what they are.

Purchased likes, bot farms, shill comments, etc - lots from that company.

Not to mention the amount of paid/sponsored reviews on blogs, review sites, YouTube, and here on Reddit - it's all market & public opinion manipulation & misinformation.

These above things wouldn't be needed if they sold top notch products, hell, look at Lamart and his vapes like the Tetra P80 - no advertising needed, just word of mouth. If you have a re-branded product, of course you gotta pull the strings to make it big.

To be honest, so many companies do this in the cannabis realm: Gorilla Grow Tents, KindLED, SuperCloset, etc - it's all part of the game and I've seen guest posts, reviews, backlinks, etc being sold for $$hundreds and even $$$thousands to appear on NYPost or whatever.

I guess it's all part of this strange game. All we can do as enthusiasts is try and be real, honest, assertive, and humble about what we know and see. I freaking love this subreddit ever since I came on here some 6 years ago and it changed my life & way I look @ weed.

IMO, people get screwed out of their money expecting a good vape and good service, not knowing they're giving their coins away to the company which has the best grey-hat and half-shady business practices.

This is seemingly the norm nowadays so maybe this is all yelling at the clouds but damn, I hope this industry doesn't go to shit like others do. Thanks r/vaporents - ya'll the real ppl out there :)

Mods, if you care for verification please ask and I can verify my identity/work

Anyone I've worked or the PR agent who may be reading this; TVape, Kevin, Josh, etc - thanks for the freelance employment and general treatment - I wish you all the best! Please keep ethical business practice at the top of priorities for the sake of the customer.
