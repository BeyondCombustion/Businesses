# [Ed's Story](https://edstnt.com/pages/about-us-1)

I guess I started all this years ago when I got the wood bug from my old man way back in the day! He hand made these really nice wooden pipes with brass bowls for himself and friends, I thought even as a kid, I can do that! I got a little older and one day I did. I made a couple for myself and friends and felt really good about it! A few years went by and I got a shop, a saw, and a drill press. Made a couple more to see if I still had it. By that time I had a nice PC and even had software to build a website. I watched a few videos, read several tutorials and before I knew it Ed’s TnT was global!

I started making pipes from cedar that was available here on the farm. Saved a few dollars and bought some domestic hardwood species and made a few more. I had always had a dugout and figured I could make one of them too. So I started making dugouts also. Started with one species and one led to another and then a variety of species in dugouts came about. They have been my bread and butter for a while and have done really well.

Had a good couple years making dugouts when a guy contacts me and tells me about this great vaporization forum… vapor what? I had never heard of vaporizers but he asked me if I would be interested in making a stem for his unit. I checked out the forum, got a look at his device, and even got in touch with this great manufacturer there that made these awesome log style vaporizers. He was a lot of help, gave me the info I needed and even sent me some needed parts to make the stem happen. There again one thing led to another and before I knew it I was making Magic-Flight Launch Box Stems and then Arizer Solo Stems.

Since my short few years making wooden stems, vaporizers have really taken off as well as my stems. I am making more and more of them every day and at times cant seem to keep up. It has opened a lot of doors for me and many great opportunities have come my way. I am so blessed to be able to do what I do and offer my work to people that appreciate and enjoy it.

I do what I love and love what I do! I am very fortunate to have made it this far and provide for my family while doing so. I had it tough the first year, I never even made a dollar until I was 18 months into the business. Since then every day has been a blessing!
